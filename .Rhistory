### Vectors ###
# Create a vector 'classes', which is a list of all the classes you're currently taking
# Create a variable 'num_classes' by measuring the length of your 'classes' vector
# Create a variable 'favorite_class' by retrieving your favorite class out of the 'classes' vector
# Create a variable 'hours_per_week' that has the number of hours you spend working on each class
# Create a variable 'hard_week' in which you work 1.5x as long as a normal week
# Use the seq command to create a vector 'nums' with numbers 100 through 199
